# Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC)

## What This Project Does
This repository shows how to build a **quantum reservoir** with PennyLane and
pair it with a **classical linear readout** for simple time-series prediction.
We also include a **classical reservoir** baseline so you can compare both
approaches side by side.

## Why Reservoir Computing Is Interesting
- A reservoir is a fixed dynamical system that turns inputs into richer features.
- Only the final readout is trained, so learning is fast and simple.
- Quantum reservoirs use quantum circuits as feature generators, which can
  provide expressive transformations even with a few qubits.

## Why We Use SVG Instead of PNG
GitHub’s CODEX interface cannot preview binary image files like PNG/JPG and often shows
“Binary files are not supported” in pull request views. To avoid this, all visualizations
in this repository are saved as lightweight SVG (vector) images. SVGs are text-based,
easy to diff, and render cleanly inside GitHub and CODEX.

## How the Quantum Reservoir Works (Plain English)
- Inputs from the time series are encoded as rotations on qubits.
- A fixed random quantum circuit mixes the information.
- Measuring Pauli-Z on each qubit gives a classical vector: the reservoir state.
- Over time, these states summarize the recent history of the sequence.
- A linear readout learns to map these states to the next value in the sequence.

## Repository Structure
- `app/`: Core Python code for datasets, reservoirs, training, and plots.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook demo.
- `examples/`: Saved SVG figures generated by the scripts.
- `tests/`: Lightweight unit tests to ensure shapes and flows are correct.
- `Dockerfile`: Container recipe for reproducible runs.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py
```

Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/qrc_demo.ipynb
```

## What You Should See
- A prediction curve where the quantum reservoir tracks the target sequence.
- A classical reservoir curve for comparison.
- A bar chart comparing mean squared error.

## Future Work
- Larger reservoirs.
- More complex time-series tasks.
- Hardware quantum reservoirs.
